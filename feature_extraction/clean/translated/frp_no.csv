19404,2013-05-24 01:39:31.387637776,565710092,"I met Hans-Christian for the first time in the lunch room in the offices of Lo Hordaland on the 2nd floor of the old people&#39;s house in Bergen, must have been in 2014. he had a short break before he was to begin at the annual meeting of lo bergen. he got up and handed me his paw, in his enormous way, as here:"
19405,2013-05-24 01:39:33.161811971,565710092,"another meeting made more of an impression. it was perhaps the same year, outside the people&#39;s house. he came hurriedly from a car, carrying flowers and a pack of dicks, probably after giving a speech somewhere. it can and has been in connection with 1. May in 2016, but the years flow a little together."
19406,2013-05-24 01:39:40.149542913,565710092,"he saw me standing at the door, stopped, held out my left hand where he was already holding flowers and miscellaneous, and said &quot;thank you for last!&quot; before he had to race on to put things away and get ready for the next mission. he really struck me as concerned with both seeing and remembering people."
19407,2013-05-24 01:39:41.965598722,565710092,"later we met at irregular intervals at lo-conferences. not infrequently he became the recipient of my critical posts, which often focused on internal issues in lo mtp eg youth work and personnel policy. I perceived him as more receptive to that than others in management."
19408,2013-05-24 01:39:43.534317571,565710092,"at youth conferences in the south, I often sat in the front and drew portraits of those who spoke. when his-christian was there, we naturally talked in that way - &quot;thank you for last&quot; - and I often showed him if I had drawn him."
19409,2013-05-24 01:39:45.102954497,565710092,"in particular, I remember putting him to the wall at a meeting in the 2019 election campaign. we opened by saying &quot;thank you for the last time&quot; to each other, before I fired with dissatisfaction with the central link, which for various reasons had not been provided with the material we needed for our local suffrage patrol."
19410,2013-05-24 01:39:46.562617344,565710092,"this surprised him, at the same time as i apple apple asked if the management shopped congressional decisions, because it seemed that the downtrodden decisions to hire student secretaries were followed slavishly, while decisions about the resource center for the undocumented were put in a drawer."
19411,2013-05-24 01:39:48.307402758,565710092,"his-christian was visibly annoyed. he cared. &quot;no axel, the lo leadership does not shop congressional resolutions!&quot; afterwards I heard via someone else that it bothered him that we had not got what we were going from central to the suffrage patrol. he genuinely cared about our movement."
19412,2013-05-24 01:39:54.825322502,565710092,"not least the suffrage patrol, where he was with us in Bergen one evening in 2017. he took us all by the hand - &quot;thank you for the last axel&quot; - and listened attentively to what we were told about how important it was for lo to engage in such outreach activities."
19413,2013-05-24 01:40:03.327197192,565710092,"hans-christian and I went on patrol and visited narvesen in olav kyrres gate and talked to those who worked there. when the evening ended, he thanked us, gave a short motivational appeal for the last sprint, and sent us on peppe&#39;s pizza for laughing centrally at his expense."
19414,2013-05-24 01:40:11.153821715,565710092,"his-christian appeared as one who was concerned with building teams, with seeing people, concerned with good tone and disarming remarks, and who really cared about the movement - one does not necessarily become a lo-leader without this, of course, but something very real about how he cared."
19415,2013-05-24 01:40:18.057662464,565710092,"a year ago I asked for &quot;more gabrielsen in monitor&quot;, and last Friday when I rarely saw the daily review, his-christian was there ang the hydro-sale and said &quot;if we are pissed yes? of course!&quot; these were matters, I thought - but at the same time he looked tired after a year at work for us."
19416,2013-05-24 01:40:24.902688768,565710092,"I will not speculate on what caused his heart to fail, but it is a fact that from Norway shut down a year ago, his Christian was at work for us workers just about all the time. he stood on when it mattered."
19417,2013-05-24 01:40:28.459536394,565710092,it was a hard blow to hear that his christian was dead. in bergen it has been glorious sun and nice weather today - but that is completely wrong. this day did not deserve to be beautiful - and as the hours passed the sorrow descended upon me like the thickest rain mist.
19418,2013-05-24 01:40:37.531811844,565710092,"we have lost our foremost man - the great, friendly giant, as many call him - and that in the midst of a time of crisis with the coming central settlement and a hostile government that is constantly attacking us."
19419,2013-05-24 01:40:42.267168783,565710092,"his-christian leaves family: trine and camille - but he also leaves another family: 44,000 members in ap and 970,000 members in lo, and we will pick up the torch after him! we will continue to build the movement and we will definitely and without a doubt take up the fight."
19420,2013-05-24 01:40:50.878013440,565710092,"thanks for last, his-christian. thanks for everything ."
19421,2013-05-24 01:43:14.012885006,37904694,"iottar joebiden understands that you are trying to suggest that I do not follow well enough. during the bid, the usa has carried out an attack that i know of in syria, against many under trump. during trump, the number of drone attacks increased compared to the number during obama. that probably explains why there is no news about this"
